      All modern webssites and web applications are built using three
      <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the
      languages of the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.
    </p>

    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
    <p>
      HTML stands for
      <strong>H</strong
      >yper<strong>T</strong>ext<strong>M</strong>arkup<strong>L</strong>anguage.
      It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe
      the content of a webpage (not a programing language)
    </p>
    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links heading, images, video, etc. Web browsers understeand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.

    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>the closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
    </ol>
